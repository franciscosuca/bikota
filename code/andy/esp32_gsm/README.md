## Low power operation
The follwing action can be taken to reduce the overal system power consumption:
 - reduce core frequency from 240 MHz to 40 MHz
 - power off GSM module while not needed
 - disable power to connected sensors, if no adequate low-power mode is provided
     - some sensors like GPS can have a long cold-start time 

### Test results
See the tables below for power and timing test results.The GSM module can be powered down and up again without poblems. If the core frequency is reduced, the time to establish a GSM connection nearly triples at 60 seconds! Hence the startup core frequency of 240 MHz is kept till a connection is established.

Further tests revealed, that changing the frequency while the modem is online and making a HTTP request, renders the modem unresponsive to any commands till a hard reset is conducted. Therefore the core frequency has to be at 240 MHz while a request is made.

The following recommendations can be made:
 - For GSM connection a core frequency of 240 MHz is used
 - While the modem is online but no request is send, the frequency can be reduced to 40 MHz
 - Before any request is send, the frequency has to be set to 240 MHz
 - While the model is powered off, the frequency can be choosen freely.

## GSM Module Support
Currently (Q3 2019) MicroPython stable release (MPSR) supports PPP (GSM) in its network stack, but it is not implemented yet. Using the MPSR, the GSM module can only be used with *AT-commands* over the UART connection
. Because of that, the requests library can not be used to issue HTTP requests.

The GSM module (SIM800L) supports two ways of issuing requests. One is trough a direct TCP connection, but this mode doesn't support SSL encryption. Hence it can not be used to issue an IOTA-API call to an IOTA-Node.
The second way is trought usage of the builtin HTTP stack. The stack supports GET and PUT requests, but doesn't allow the HEADER and BODY of an request to be customized. Therefore it can not be used to to issue an IOTA-API call to an IOTA-Node.

In conclusion, the MPSR can not be used to interact with an IOTA-Node. Therefore the custom build MicroPython firmware by [loboris](https://github.com/loboris/MicroPython_ESP32_psRAM_LoBo/wiki/gsm) will be used for development of this project. Last commits to the repository were made in summer 2018. Because of this, it doesn't contain relevant functionalities with are implemented in the stable releases. These functionalities are:
 - deepsleep with wake-up source 
 - DHT22 library
Therefore the to be developed prototype might not be able to suport any low-power modes to enhace battery operation time. Additionaly a custom solution to interact with the DHT22 module has to be developed.
