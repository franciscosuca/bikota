NodeJS Dummy Server

The purpose of this server is for testing HTTP request from a NodeJS server hosted in the JupyterLab.

You can test the server locally or in your favorite cloud solution. Please, follow the next steps to run the test.

Install NodeJS on your local or remote equipment. In this case I used ubuntu 18.04, and installed through the terminal using the following command:

´
sudo apt-get install nodejs
´
